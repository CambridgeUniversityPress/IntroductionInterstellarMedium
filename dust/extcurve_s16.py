def extcurve(x, ra=None, dra=None, lam=None):
    """ Return extinction curve, for R(V)-like parameter x.

    Returns the extinction curve, A(lambda)/A(5420 A), according to
    Schlafly+2016, for the parameter "x," which controls the overall shape of
    the extinction curve in an R(V)-like way.  The extinction curve returned
    is a callable function, which is then invoked with the wavelength, in
    angstroms, of interest.

    The extinction curve is based on broad band photometry between the PS1 g
    band and the WISE W2 band, which have effective wavelengths between 5000
    and 45000 A.  The extinction curve is blindly extrapolated outside that
    range.  The gray component of the extinction curve is fixed by enforcing
    A(H)/A(K) = 1.55 (Indebetouw+2005).  The gray component is relatively
    uncertain, and its variation with x is largely made up.

    Args:
        x: some number controlling the shape of the extinction curve
        ra: extinction vector at anchor wavelengths, default to Schlafly+2016
        dra: derivative of extinction vector at anchor wavelengths, default to
             Schlafly+2016
        lam: anchor wavelengths (angstroms), default to Schlafly+2016

    Returns: the extinction curve E, so the extinction alam = A(lam)/A(5420 A)
        is given by: 
        A = extcurve(x)
        alam = A(lam)
