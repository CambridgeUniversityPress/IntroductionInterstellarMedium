## Companion to "Introduction to the Interstellar Medium" by Jonathan Williams

Recreate figures from the book and use the code as starting points for some of the questions.
Most figures are created in python as [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that will open as an executable in [binder](https://mybinder.org/).
Other figures are created in [tikz](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package) which require downloading and running 'pdflatex'.
A remaining few were created in [keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/) and are only available here as pdf.
Use the control key when clicking on a link to open it in a new tab.
